Node data are generated at the start and stored in respective dimension's
directory.

Nodes are spaced at least 256 blocks apart from each other.

They denote major regions (differences in biome).

Stored data include:
* temp/humid
* location and size of villages (if present)
* flora/fauna

Since all nodes are at least 256 blocks away from any other, we can place
villages within a region as long as no portion of them lies more than 128
blocks away from a node. If we don't mind villages crossing region boundaries,
then we can get away with going farther away.

Regions are Voronoi diagrams; tiles get an X/Y fudge factor based on Perlin
noise so the boundaries aren't perfect lines.

TODO: also scrap UNBT in favor of an alternate format?
Sized int types themselves are not that important (though sized int ARRAYS
are); it would suffice to have storage types for Int's, Rat's, and Num's.
