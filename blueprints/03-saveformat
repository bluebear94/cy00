Save format:

Should be easy to read and write from Perl 6 without special shenanigans.
(This means storing data about metaobjects.)
Should be reasonably compact. (Perhaps using zlib.)
Use backrefs to reduce redundant strings.
Should support packed arrays.
Should support bigints.

Will probably need a trait `is transient` to mark fields that shouldn't be
serialized.
Will probably have trouble serializing classes that override methods, or
compose roles.
